## About this Part

Congrats!
You have reached the last Part of this Sprint.
In this part, all the skills you've learned so far will be put to the test.
As the final assignment of this Sprint, you will analyse the Coursera Course Dataset.
You will have to apply all that you have learned about Data Visualization & Data Analysis to complete this task.
You'll notice that in this project you have fewer explicitly stated requirements.
Our expectation is that you'll use your own judgement how to perform the analysis and how to select the most important avenues of exploration.
You'll have to iteratively raise hypotheses and use your data analysis skills to get answers.

P.S. We don't expect perfection - as you progress through the course you will continue to improve and there will be plenty more opportunities to practice and apply your skills in the upcoming sprints. For now just use what you've learned and try your best!

## Objectives for this Part

- Practice working with data from Kaggle.
- Practice performing basic EDA.
- Practice visualizing data with Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- Practice reading data, performing queries and filtering data using Pandas.

## Requirements

- Download the data from [Coursera Course Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/siddharthm1698/coursera-course-dataset).
- Load the data using Pandas.
- Perform data cleaning.
- Perform exploratory data analysis.
- Provide clear explanations in your notebook. Your explanations should inform the reader what you are trying to achieve, the results you got, and what these results mean.
- Provide suggestions on how your analysis could be improved.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Adherence to the requirements. How well did you meet the requirements?
- Visualization quality. Did you use charts effectively to visualize patterns in the data? Are your visualizations properly labeled? Did you use colors effectively? Did you adhere to the principle of proportional ink?
- Code quality. Was your code well-structured? Did you use the appropriate levels of abstraction? Did you remove commented out and unused code? Did you adhere to the PEP8?
- Code performance. Did you use the suitable algorithms and data structures to solve the problems?

## Project Review

During the review you should present your project as if talking to a technical team lead and a senior co-worker. You can assume they have strong data science and software engineering skills - they will understand technical jargon, they are expected to notice things that could have been done better, and they will ask about the choices you've made (especially if you've made some questionable choices). Be careful not to spend time explaining the more basic aspects of your code: Your presentation should focus on the more complex aspects.

During a review, you might be asked questions that test your understanding of key topics.

- What is the difference between continuous and discrete distributions?
- What is a Bernoulli trial?
- What is a Standard Normal Distribution?
- What is a random variable?
- Explain the Bayes's Theorem
- Explain the Simpson's paradox
